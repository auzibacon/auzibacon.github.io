                <p>Students of color and women are historically underrepresented in the workplace, but these experiences
                    also carry over into the classroom environment.</p>

                <p>The University of Maryland is a majority white institution with 47% minority students enrolled as of
                    the Fall 2021 semester, according to its undergraduate student profile of nearly 31,000 students.
                    While current President Darryll J. Pines’ promised commitments to advance the university through
                    student, faculty, and staff diversity when he was appointed to the position in 2021, students have
                    reflected on their experiences with both their racial and gender identities at UMD.</p>

                <p>And, possibly for Jedidiah Kouadio: a freshman mechanical engineering major, who said that her
                    experience at the university has been less isolating than she expected it to be. However, the
                    environment of the Clark School of Engineering doesn’t help her surround herself with other non-men
                    and people of color. She said that many men and white people underestimate her knowledge in the
                    classroom.

                <p>She said that while working in a group of eight students, where only two were men, people still
                    refused to communicate with her. Kouadio explained that it isn’t easy to deal with people assuming
                    she’s incompetent or doesn’t fulfill certain skills required for assignments.

                <p>Kouadio has had some non-male professors, but hasn’t had any professors of color in her engineering
                    classes. She had a female mechanics teacher for one of her first engineering classes at the
                    university.</p>

                <p>“She was very vocal about how hard it is to become an engineer. She was very supportive,” she
                    explained.</p>

                <p>Despite not having any professors of color, she said that the representation was better than nothing.

                <p>Bryan Bokino, a Black sophomore and transfer student and computer science major, said that coming to
                    a bigger university has felt isolating. He originally came from a small college in New York, but
                    realized that his feelings are also because it’s hard to find people with similar identities to
                    himself.</p>

                <p>“I feel like the more people there are around you, the harder it is just to find people,” he said.
                    “People are in their own little world.”</p>

                <p>He said that in the computer science department, they’re clearly trying to be more inclusive and
                    diverse. He said that they have panels introducing people of color in the field as speakers, which
                    shows a conscious effort on their behalf. </p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>Bokino said it’s not the department’s fault that it isn’t more diverse and that there aren’t more
                    people going into the programs. Even though it’s not necessarily their fault, he said that he’d want
                    them to do more reaching out for programs that they offer.</p>

                <p>“The university itself could do more,” he said, using Black History Month as an example. “I feel
                    like they up their game sometimes and double down.”</p>

                <p> As a part of Pines’ fearlessly forward program, he also committed to creating an inclusive
                    environment. This included launching the TerrapinSTRONG initiative, which was an onboarding program
                    for new faculty, staff and students.

                <p>Selah Thom, a Black junior psychology major, said that the TerrapinSTRONG isn’t as strong as the
                    university portrays it to be. She said many students can skim through videos and quizzes to meet the
                    requirements, but don’t actually take it seriously.</p>

                <p>She said the initiative should be replaced with diversity and cultural competency courses, which
                    would be more in depth.</p>

                <p>“It’s important for people to understand the history of Maryland because it doesn’t get enough
                    recognition,” she said.</p>

                <p> She added that Pines’ initiative to diversify the staff and faculty at the university isn’t as
                    widespread as simply hiring more professors from diverse backgrounds. She said that Pines focused
                    specifically on STEM fields before becoming president, and the improvement in those departments is
                    noticeable.</p>

                <p> However, it’s severely lacking in diversity for other fields like the social sciences, arts, and
                    English. When it comes to the psychology department, she said that she hasn’t had any women of color
                    professors until her third year at the university.</p>

                <p> “I feel like other majors really need that,” she said. “They would really benefit from hearing
                    diverse perspectives because that is the foundation of their studies and majors.”</p>
